# Hello Landon, Welcome to your new computer!

This computer is a **raspberry pi 4** and it is a computer for hackers! The operating system is not Apple or windows, but Linux! Its a higly customizable open source operating system thats preferred by true hackers. 

Part of the excitement of having this computer is it is the best place to learn about computers and how to talk to them!
When you learn how to properly talk to computers, I think it goes without saying that you can achieve some really powerful things!

I outlined some steps below for getting started, but before we get into that, I need to explain a couple areas where I left various resources for you. 

---
## Resources
- **Gmail** - I made you a new gmail at landonmcavoy123@gmail.com. This is a professional email you can use from now on. 
- **Flash Drive** - On the flash drive which you can find on the desktop called usb-stick, I left some folders containing walkthroughs on scratch, the command line, and python
- **Google Chrome** - On chrome, I added bookmarks for you email, but also chatgpt, your github (which i'll explain later), and codecademy. I also added a youtube feed and shorts blocker, add blocker, and dark mode, which is the way I have my computer set up mostly. The robot face is the dark mode switch. If a website looks weird, you can click the robot face and toggle it off for that site.  
- **Passwords Doc** - I left a document on the desktop called passwords, move those over to the password manager of your choice to keep them safe.

## Getting Started learning code
You can learn any of this in any order you want, preferably in the order that is most fun and interesting!
1. Learn more scatch to understand the basics of code. Create several games that use while loops, variables, and other coding mechanics. 
2. Learn to program the robot, to learn about real world applications.
3. Learn HTML basics on codecademy. This lets you make websites. Learn on codecademy.
4. Learn python to learn how to work with data. Learn on codecademy, resource is also on usb-stick
5. Learn how VScode aka Visual studio code, works as a code editor
6. Learn the command line (aka bash, aka terminal) so you can install programs, navigate files, and execute powerful commands to control your computer. Google: "how to navigate in bash", "how to install programs in bash". I included a pdf on the usb-stick for some of the basics. Definitly learn ls and cd and apt-get. 
7. Learn Github so you can save different versions of the same project easily, and so you can collaborate on code with other people. *You are currently reading this document on github under your own profile, in your own repo called welcome, and this is the README.md file. The file type is .md which is markdown, which lets me format this document nicely. You can press the edit button to see how the markdown foratting code works.*
8. Learn vim motions to program faster and easier. Vim lets you program and move around without needing to touch your mouse. (type in `nvim +Tutor` in terminal to open tutorial) and install vim vscode extension. NOTE! Dont install the vim extension until you do the tutorial and know the basics of how to use vim. 
9. Get a raspberry pi module, attatch it to the pin outs on the raspi, and make a project with it! One cool one to look into is the camera module. Just google "raspberry pi camera module"

## The best way to learn how to talk to a computer
The answer is fun projects! Learn something cool, like how to make a custom minecraft server, or how to make a roblox game, or how to play a prank on a friend using code. Maybe we could build more robots! 

When you are doing those projects, it might feel overwhelming on where to begin. That is where ChatGPT, google, reddit, and codecademy come into play. 

**If you need to learn the basics in order to complete a certain project**, start off with codecademy. It can quickly teach you the basics of any programming language. 

**If you need help figuring out code, have any questions about how to do something, or have a bug in your code**, you can use chatgpt. ChatGPT is great for getting really custom answers quickly. Sometimes I will paste in my code and say, "this code isn't working, what did I do wrong" and it will give me the right answer! Sometimes I'll just ask chatgpt to explain how code works using my favorite game, Zelda as a code example. 

**If you cannot get answers from chatgpt and need help from a very knowledgable human**, use reddit. Definitly create a reddit account and choose an anonymous username, and sign up to various reddit communities like r/python. In any of these communities, you can usually get your questions answered with in a day. People on there are really nice and helpful. I use this all the time!

**For everything else, use google.**

I hope that you can find some fun projects that light your passion. When you finish your first big coding project, it really is one of the best feelings ever! One of the reasons I fell in love with code, is that it is the world's biggest lego toychest. You can literally connect any piece of code to any other piece of code ever made, and once you know how to connect those pieces in any way you want, you'll feel like the most powerful person it the world! I hope that code can become your addiction like it has become for me. The possibilities of what you can create are really endless. 

But more than anything, I hope we can become coding buddies and work on more fun project together!
